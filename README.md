# List

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation of the "list" data structure, unlike the standard implementation, stores data in a single array. 
Due to the fact that the data is not scattered in random order in memory, the function of linearization of the list by logical number is available.
There is also an html log file in which all dumps are saved in graphical or text form.
